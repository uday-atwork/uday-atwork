Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Uday!

Software engineer, polygot, learner. Love to paint, practice martial-arts and play outdoor games!

An experienced software engineer with a get-it-done attitude towards task at hand; leading multiple teams and wearing a new hat quite often - with ever growing curiousity. Willing to learn and explore paths untravelled.


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m actively building large scale distributed systems, often using Java & Python tech stack

ðŸŒ± Presently working on GenerativeAI powered ecosystems with need for high availability and scalability at core

ðŸ¤” Always looking for peers to connect, discuss and colaborate on ideas!
